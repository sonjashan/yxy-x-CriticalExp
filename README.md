# yxy-x-CriticalExp
I wrote backtracking searches (DFS) to gain intuition on morphisms, when applied to known sequences like TM or VTM, will give infinite binary sequences that
1) avoid the pattern yxyâ€™x where |x| and |y| are at least 2 (binary alphabet, y' is the inverse), and 
2) have critical exponent 13/5 (we have found many examples) or more ideally 5/2 (not found).

I wrote a library of functions to test n/p powerfreeness (e.g. 7/3, alfalfa) and yxy'x pattern avoidance.
